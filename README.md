# To-Do List App üìù

 This project is a to do list application created using Python and more specifically, a way to practice using the tkinter module for GUI development. 

## Features 
- **Add Tasks**: Easily add tasks to your to-do list.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks once completed or if they are no longer needed.
- **Simple Interface**: User-friendly design powered by Tkinter.
- **Storage** Save your to do list for later.
  

## Installation 
To run the To-Do List App on your local machine, you should be able to simply use the code from the main file on your machine whichever way you run your python code.  

## Requirements 
- Python 3.7+
- Tkinter (included with Python standard library)

## How to Use 
1. Open the application by running the script.
2. Use the text input to add and remove tasks from your to do list.
3. clear all tasks to start over.

## Future Improvements 
- **Cursor**: Will try to simulate a cursor so that the user can see where they are about to edit their list.
- **Scrolling**: May add a scrolling feature later on for those who have more to do. 
- **Desktop App** Will be making this application a downloadable file like sticky notes, so you can run the file and leave it open to see your list all day long!
